I am less confused. I was having a hard time following this and still have difficulty learning in this method (seeing the code written out, but not seeing what it does at that particular moment is confusing for me).

This practice used connect, which allowed us to parse the URL.
This project initially allowed us to follow paths that were typed into the browser. It used our data files from the capstone and displayed that information on the page when the user would type /teams or /leagues. It also gave a 404 error.

Next we added buttons that displayed the data in the console.
